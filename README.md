# PortScanner
PortScanner is a python based tool. That will scan for TCP connection on user specified ports. It accepts both IP/domain as target. [I have made this port scanner as the part of my learning python & it's not as extensive as regular scanners!]

# Notes
1. Python3 have to be installed
2. "Help" feature is added. Type "python PortScanner -h"

# Usage
python PortScanner -H <target IP/domain> -p <port>
